### MsgTester
Lets users create and maintain a repository of financial test messages. Users can trigger test runs on single or sets of messages and the gui will display test results including diff to previous runs

deployment:
delete c:\msgtester\node_modules
delete c:\msgtester\package-lock.json
call c:\msgtester\meteor npm install --production
call c:\msgtester\meteor build --server-only c:\temp --architecture os.linux.x86_64

copy the created msgtester.tar.gz to my server (rhel7) where I previously installed passenger according to the brilliant guide at https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/walkthroughs/deploy/

On the server I unpacked the bundle and created and ran the build again:
cd /opt/passenger/msgtester/bundle/programs/server
meteor npm install --production

then created a new Passenger config file under /opt/passenger/msgtester/bundle
vi Passengerfile.json
With the standard contents plus the METEOR_SETTING as a single escaped json string
{
 // Tell Passenger that this is a Meteor app.
 "app_type": "node",
 "startup_file": "main.js",
 "envvars": {
   // Tell your app where MongoDB is
   "MONGO_URL": "mongodb://localhost:27017/msgtesterdev",
   // Tell your app what its root URL is
   "ROOT_URL": "http://msgtestdev.vps.no",
   "METEOR_SETTINGS": "{ \"private\": {\"postgres\": {\"user\": \"myPgUser\", \"host\": \"localhost\", \"database\": \"mypgdb\", \"password\": \"MyPgPassword\", \"port\": 5432}, \"MAIL_URL\": \"\"}}"
 },
 // Store log and PID file in parent directory
 "log_file": "../passenger.log",
 "pid_file": "../passenger.pid"
 // Run the app in a production environment. The default value is "development".
 "environment": "production",
 // Run Passenger on port 80, the standard HTTP port.
 "port": 3000,
 // Tell Passenger to daemonize into the background.
 "daemonize": true,
 // Tell Passenger to run the app as the given user. Only has effect
 // if Passenger was started with root privileges.
 "user": "myuser"
}
then I ran the app with 
passenger start --address ::

UPDATE:
copy new msgtester.tar.gz to /opt/incentage/passenger dir on the server.
Then go to 
> cd /opt/incentage/passenger/msgtesterdev/tmp
 and unpack with 
> tar zxvf /opt/incentage/passenger/msgtester.tar.gz

copy passenger file from original bundle dir to the new unpacked one.
> cp /opt/incentage/passenger/msgtestdev/bundle/Passengerfile.json /opt/incentage/passenger/msgtestdev/tmp/bundle/Passengerfile.json
go to 
> cd /opt/incentage/passenger/msgtesterdev/tmp/bundle/programs/server
Rebuild with
> npm install --production
> npm prune --production

stop the current running app with
> cd /opt/incentage/passenger/msgtestdev/bundle
> passenger stop

remove any old backups, rename and replace the existing bundle dir with the new unpacked one
> cd /opt/incentage/passenger/msgtestdev
> rm -rf bundle.old
> mv bundle/ bundle.old
> mv tmp/bundle .

restart
> cd bundle
> passenger start --address ::
